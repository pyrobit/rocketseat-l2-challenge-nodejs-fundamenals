# Nodejs Fundamentals Challenge
by RocketSeat

Develop a backend using nodejs that controls the ledger like balance (income, outcome) and rules to prevent ilegal actions like:
* Outcome transactions bigger than current funds.
* Do not allow transactions with type different from income and outcome.

Next steps in a side project I will improve this to also implement a system of investments and loan simulations.
